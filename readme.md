# ArduForge

ArduForge is a collection of C++ classes for various common, popular devices used within the Arduino environment. All classes feature extensive in-code documentation, examples, and wiring schematics. I hope this will make it easy to understand how to use the classes and devices. Due to the thorough documentation, this project may also be suitable for teaching electronics to novice users in electronics or students in general.


# List of devices ready to use
* BinarySensor - debounced binary sensor such as a switch or hall sensor
* CC1101 - a popular mid-range radio transceiver
* MF52 - a common thermistor

# Project structure
The *./lib* directory contains finished classes ready to use as well as examples and the wiring schematics and the *./src* directory contains the working files and prototypes not yet tested or finished. The *./doc* directory contains the current documentation generated by doxygen (www.doxygen.nl).
