# ArduoForge

ArduForge is a collection of C++ classes for various common devices used within the Arduino environment. All classes feature extensive in-code documentation, examples, and wiring schematics. I hope this will make it easy to understand how to use the classes and devices. Due to the thorough documentation, this project may also be suitable for teaching electronics to novice users in electronics or students in general.

The *./lib* directory contains finished classes ready to use as well as examples and the wiring schematics. The *./src* directory contains the working files and prototypes not yet tested or finished.

# List of devices ready to use
* BinarySensor - a binary sensor e.g. switch/hall sensor
* CC1101 - a popular mid-range radio transceiver
* MF52 - a common thermistor
